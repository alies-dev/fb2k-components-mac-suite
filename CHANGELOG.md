---

## SimPlaylist

### [Unreleased]

#### Fixed
- Dragging tracks or folders from the album list into the playlist did nothing
- Tracks dragged from the library tree failed with "Access denied" when their path contained a space (scheme-less file URL was imported percent-encoded)
- Home key jumped to an arbitrary point mid-list instead of the first track in grouped playlists (End was wrong the same way but masked by clamping)
- An album cover too large to cache was re-decoded on every redraw, on up to four threads, for as long as it was on screen
- Invalid grouping patterns previewed as the track's filename instead of reporting themselves as invalid
- An out-of-range stored preset index left the preferences page showing blank pattern fields and silently discarding every edit
- Typing a grouping pattern compiled and ran it on the main thread on every keystroke; leaving the field rebuilt the playlist twice
- Column headers scrolled behind the album-art strip remained clickable, draggable and resizable
- Custom column edits could be reverted by a stale copy held by the preferences page
- Shift-click after a playlist switch extended the selection from the previous playlist's anchor
- Drop indicator appeared up to ~150 px below the cursor when dragging into grouped playlists, and the drop landed at the indicator — drop positions were scored against uniform row heights that ignored taller group headers
- Delete/Backspace with an empty selection hung the app
- With multiple SimPlaylist panels open, one panel's rebuild cancelled another's in-progress group detection
- Album art cache is now bounded by decoded size (256 MB) as well as image count, which previously allowed ~1 GB resident
- Assorted crash guards and correctness fixes from a multi-pass code review

#### Changed
- Removed ~1,100 lines of unreferenced legacy rendering code (node/boundary drawing, disabled flat mode, `GroupNode`/`GroupBoundary`)
- Unified the group-data application sequence that was duplicated across five call sites and had drifted between copies

### [1.5.1] - 2026-07-07

#### Added
- "Keep playback in its playlist" behavior option (default on) — prevents ReFacets library browsing from redirecting playback continuation; finishing a track no longer jumps playback to the browsed selection

### [1.5.0] - 2026-07-02

#### Added
- "Focus Playing Now" context menu item — selects the playing track and scrolls it to the center of the view, switching playlists when needed
- Cover art for tracks on external volumes with smarter companion-file matching (thanks @Scannou, #27)

#### Fixed
- Per-playlist scroll positions restore pixel-exactly across playlist switches and restarts (previously drifted by up to a full screen per round trip; ungrouped and very large playlists never saved their position at all)
- Stale selections: external selection changes are no longer silently ignored after clicking an already-selected track
- Playing column ">" no longer lingers on the previous track (thanks @Scannou, #28)
- Metadata broadcast after playlist refresh/switch (thanks @Scannou, #25)
- Cover art bleed-through between neighboring albums (thanks @Scannou, #23)

#### Changed
- Core playlist logic extracted into pure, unit-tested modules (~108k checks gating every build); codebase optimization and testability, no functional change intended

### [1.4.6] - 2026-05-17

#### Added
- Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z undo/redo for playlist modifications
- Finder open override (replace / append / send to named playlist)
- Pattern Help side panel with live preview and typo warnings
- Scrollable preferences page

#### Fixed
- Background metadata refresh: `?` rows now resolve immediately after foobar2000 reads tags
- Default preset uses `$if2(%album artist%,%artist%)` fallback
- Improved title-format help text with worked examples

### [1.4.5] - 2026-04-29

#### Added
- Optional album duration appended to group headers (toggle in Display Settings)

#### Fixed
- Groups now refresh as track metadata is resolved during import
- Column widths no longer reset when adjacent UI panels are resized; auto-resize distributes space proportionally (thanks @Scannou, #19)

### [1.4.4] - 2026-04-06

#### Added
- Queue # column showing queue position per track (brackets or accent color style)
- Double-click preserves playback queue (enabled by default)
- Behavior preferences section

#### Fixed
- Q key now queues all selected tracks, not just the focused one

### [1.4.3] - 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- **Space key**: Now toggles play/pause instead of track selection; starts playback when stopped.
- **Scroll rendering**: Tracks no longer appear blank when scrolling to albums outside the initial viewport.
- **Import sort order**: Tracks sorted by metadata (album artist, album, track number) instead of filename.

### [1.4.0] - 2026-02-10

#### Added
- Drag tracks from SimPlaylist to Finder to copy files out (preference toggle for move-by-default)
- Debug rendering diagnostics overlay for blank/unmapped rows

#### Fixed
- Album art cache eviction: replaced NSCache with manual LRU dictionary to prevent blink/disappear during fast scrolling
- Stale subgroup caches on empty playlists

### [1.3.4] - 2026-02-08

#### Fixed
- Blank rows appearing during scroll due to NSScrollView copy-on-scroll preserving stale pixels after group data changes

### [1.3.3] - 2026-02-07

#### Fixed
- Album art and group column misaligned with Group Header Spacing (incorrect height calculation for header rows)
- View jumps on auto-advance in long playlists (metadata updates no longer trigger full rebuild)
- Enter key now correctly plays focused track

### [1.3.2] - 2026-02-03

#### Added
- Group Header Spacing setting: Compact / Normal (+6px) / Larger (+12px)

#### Fixed

- Subgroup headers in style 3 now display before their tracks
- Memory safety: replaced unsafe `__weak` pointers in C++ containers with NSHashTable
- Cache memory pressure: bounded formatted values cache with proper eviction
- Path traversal: playlist name sanitization prevents directory escape

### [1.3.1] - 2026-01-26

#### Fixed
- Orphaned custom columns: renaming a custom column no longer causes it to become unmanageable

## Playlist Organizer

### [1.5.1] - 2026-09-25

#### Changed
- **Requires macOS 12**: built with Xcode 27, which cannot target macOS 11

#### Fixed
- **Crash on restart after a repair**: the migration now runs on a staged copy and is swapped in by rename, so reopening foobar2000 while it works cannot disturb the live database
- **Database growth**: rows are renamed in place instead of copied and deleted, so the file no longer doubles during a migration and needs no VACUUM
- **Migration speed**: 29.1s down to 4.6s on a 2.35 GB database, byte-identical result
- **Faster restart after a repair**: instant APFS clone for the working copy; relaunch no longer waits on cleanup
- **Reclaiming old bloat**: the staged copy is compacted when mostly free pages, recovering space lost to earlier versions

#### Added
- **`Scripts/volume_registry_prune.sh`**: removes unused volume bookmarks for the music share; dry run by default, refuses to write while foobar2000 runs

### [1.5.0] - 2026-08-26

#### Added
- **Automatic Volume UUID Sync**: Repairs stale `mac-volume://` UUIDs in playlists after SMB/Tailscale remounts. Off by default
- **Volume self-heal**: Registers a mounted volume foobar2000 has no working bookmark for, then remaps the stale playlists. Off by default
- **Metadb cache migration**: Moves cached metadata to the live UUID after foobar2000 quits; backed up, transactional, verified and compacted
- **Finder file drop**: Drop files or folders onto a playlist node to append them (thanks @Scannou, #36)
- **FTH Theme Import**: Imports tree and tracks from old Windows foo_plorg themes (developed as 1.4.0)
- **Corrupted Playlist Detection**: Finds and safely removes playlists foobar2000 cannot load (developed as 1.4.0)
- **`Scripts/metadb_cleanup.sh`**: Offline tool that reclaims metadb space from dead-UUID copies

#### Changed
- **Testable core**: Pure logic extracted into Foundation-only modules; 270 unit checks gate every build
- **Network Volumes off by default**: Power-user feature; opt in from Preferences

#### Fixed
- **Restart after repair**: No longer reopens foobar2000 while the database is being written ("database is locked", "metadb is corrupted")
- **Concurrent migrations**: Only one migration runs per session; two were observed running at once
- **Database growth**: Migrations now compact the file, which previously kept its largest-ever size permanently
- **Lower-case UUIDs**: Cached metadata could be deleted instead of migrated when a UUID was stored in lower case
- **Config load failure**: No longer mistaken for an empty configuration, which could replace the saved folder tree
- **Malformed input crashes**: FTH, DeaDBeeF, YAML, Vox and drag-payload parsers hardened
- **Path traversal**: Crafted playlist paths can no longer escape their drive
- **Import databases**: Vox and Strawberry libraries opened read-only
- **Repair Volume UUIDs window**: Close cancels cleanly; backup failure re-enables it; reopening reuses the window
- **Build tooling**: Failed project regeneration aborts the build; compiler warnings no longer filtered out

### [1.4.0] - developed 2026-02-14, never published (ships in 1.5.0)

#### Added
- FTH Theme Import: import playlist tree structure and tracks from old Windows foo_plorg theme files, with Windows-to-macOS path mapping
- Corrupted Playlist Detection: file-based corruption checks plus crash-marker system for SDK-level crashers; safe filesystem-based removal; preference and "Check Now" button

#### Fixed
- Nil safety in path encoding prevents crash on nil tree node names
- Import exception handling resets view state on failure
- Playlist item count access skipped for known-bad playlists to prevent startup crashes

### [1.3.2] - 2026-01-15

#### Added
- Network Volume UUID Remapping tool: manual repair window for orphaned playlist entries; scans for `mac-volume://` references, detects current UUID for mounted volumes, backs up before applying

### [1.3.0] - 2026-01-03

#### Added
- Drag-hover-expand: hover over folders to auto-expand, hover over playlists to activate them
- Accept track drops from SimPlaylist onto playlists (appends to end)
- Playlist item count updates immediately after drop
- Option key modifier: hold Option during drag for Copy operation (default is Move)

### [1.2.0] - 2025-12-30

## Waveform Seekbar

### [1.2.0] - 2026-07-02

#### Added
- Glass background option: translucent blur background, same effect as SimPlaylist; toggles live without restart
- Background color wells support transparency; translucent background tints the glass blur
- "Preferences..." context menu item opens the seekbar preferences page directly

#### Fixed
- Choppy playback cursor movement (redraw threshold now pixel-based, animated cursor effects redraw continuously)
- Played-portion shading no longer paints the opaque background color over the glass blur
- Stale waveform scans no longer overwrite the current track on rapid track changes
- Cache store/lookup race and listener deadlock fixes

### [1.1.0] - 2025-12-29

#### Added
- Context menu with right-click on waveform seekbar
- Lock Width / Lock Height options to prevent resizing
- Lock settings persist across restarts

### [1.0.0] - 2025-12-28

#### Added
- Initial release

---

## Last.fm Scrobbler

### [Unreleased]

#### Changed
- Core logic extracted into pure, unit-tested modules gating every build (playback state machine, Last.fm signing/parsing, error policy, queue/dedup, streak validity, streak discovery walk, widget layout math). No functional change intended.
- Widget layout computed in a geometry pass shared by drawing and hit-testing (was a side effect of drawing)

#### Fixed
- Latent double-queue of an already-scrobbled track on playback stop
- Streak inflated by one day when the user had not scrobbled today

### [1.4.0] - 2026-05-17

#### Added
- Scrobble Queue table in preferences with multi-select delete

#### Fixed
- Scrobbles lost for artists with `&`, `=`, `+`, `#` in name — by [@Scannou](https://github.com/Scannou)
- Album art not appearing until view switch
- UI freeze during cache save
- Nil pointer crashes in image loading
- Double-scrobble on rapid track changes

#### Changed
- Async album art downloads with NSCache
- Hardened auth flow, keychain storage, and notification observers

### [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

- Live Now Playing indicator (zero API calls)
- Auto-refresh on scrobble (15s debounced)

### [1.2.0] - 2026-02-01

#### Added
- Artist image scraping from Last.fm website
- Track images via album artwork lookup
- Widget background customization (color picker and glass effect)
- Reload button and rank display in tooltip

#### Changed

- Now Playing notifications
- Offline queue with automatic retry

---

## Album Art

### [1.1.0] - 2026-07-09

#### Added
- Fetch Missing Artwork: search Cover Art Archive, iTunes, Deezer, and TIDAL (optional) for album art via right-click
- Lightbox preview with type filters and multi-type selection; save to album folder and/or embed into file tags
- Unit test suite gating every build

#### Fixed
- Save-to-folder failed for track paths containing spaces
- Restarted searches could complete with stale or missing results
- Thumbnails could attach to the wrong results; footer clicks could open the wrong image
- First search after startup could falsely report offline; offline state now actually disables the menu item
- Track changes now cancel in-flight searches and clear stale results
- "Save Selected" could silently save fewer images than claimed; lightbox window leaked on every presentation
- Remembered "embed" preference was ignored for multi-image saves; remembered choices can now be reset from the context menu

### [1.0.2] - 2025-12-30

#### Fixed
- Layout compression when no album art is available

### [1.0.1] - 2025-12-29

#### Fixed
- Album art images affecting parent container width, causing column resizing between tracks

### [1.0.0] - 2025-12-28

#### Added
- Initial release
- Multiple artwork types: front cover, back cover, disc art, icon, artist photo
- Selection-based display with now playing fallback
- Interactive navigation arrows on hover

---

## Queue Manager

### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- Multi-row drag reorder (previously only the first selected row moved)

#### Changed
- Pure logic extracted into SDK-free Core units (QueueReorderPlanner, QueueFormatting, QueueDropParser) with unit tests gating every build
- Column metadata consolidated into a single source of truth; dead QueueHeaderView removed; real component GUIDs and corrected metadata

#### Fixed
- Build failure after shared UIStyles.h dropped `selectedBackgroundColorForGlass()`; selection now uses `selectedBackgroundColor()` like SimPlaylist
- Code review cleanups: duration formatting UB on malformed track lengths, duplicated title-format error handling, orphan sentinel consistency, selection recolor efficiency
- Reorder debounce flag never suppressed callbacks (redundant double reload per reorder); reorder now exception-safe with stale items re-added as orphans; SimPlaylist drops validate the source playlist index

### [1.1.2] - 2026-02-09

#### Changed
- Switched from custom QueueHeaderView to native NSTableHeaderView for proper resize support

#### Fixed
- Column resize via header divider dragging
- SimPlaylist drag/drop NSDictionary format handling

- Volume slider with dB display
- Customizable track info rows using titleformat expressions
- Drag-to-reorder buttons in editing mode
- Compact and normal display modes

## Tidal Integration

### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- Save to library (music.hq): personal playlist context-menu export of selected tidal:// tracks into a configured library root using the music.hq layout (genre collection / artist / `Artist [YYYY] Title`, with `[Releases]` and `[Compilations]` slots). Genre resolution: existing artist folder on disk > remembered choice > one-time picker. DASH FLAC remuxed losslessly to tagged `.flac` via ffmpeg; `cover.jpg` fetched per album; existing files skipped. Gated by the Preferences > Library folder setting (unset hides the feature)
- DASH prefetch: the next track in the active playlist is resolved and its segments pre-assembled into an in-memory blob cache while the current track plays, so lossless/hi-res tracks open instantly instead of stalling ~3-4s on the segment download. Byte-capped (~320 MB), cleared on quit
- Pure Core modules extracted from SDK/network code (testability refactor, no functional change): `ManifestParser`, `StreamResolutionPolicy`, `HTTPResponsePolicy`, `ResponseParser` (replacing 11 inline API-parsing loops), `SyncPlanner`, `BrowserLogic`, `DashCachePolicy`, `TidalLog`
- Standalone unit-test suite (425 checks, 11 binaries, ASan+UBSan) gating every build via `Scripts/run_tests.sh`

#### Fixed
- Decoder open failures now log the chosen decoder and the exception instead of silently skipping the track
- Debug-logging preference honored after restart (cache was only synced on toggle)
- Static-destructor logging can no longer touch torn-down fb2k services
- Pull sync no longer truncates playlists at 200 tracks (all sync fetches paginate to completeness); a failed remote fetch can no longer wipe a local playlist (excluded from the plan instead of diffing as empty)
- fb2k playlist state read only on the main thread in sync previews; sync shared state serialized; request bursts bounded to 4 concurrent
- Token refresh is single-flight (concurrent callers get the real result instead of a 1s sleep guess); sign-out during refresh can no longer resurrect a session
- Two crash fixes (nil dictionary key in push-sync apply, std::string(NULL) in DASH 403 re-open) plus 58 review fixes: JSON type guards, album-art data cache, stale-response guards, leak fix, dedupe

#### Security
- tidal:// content IDs validated before use in authenticated API paths (blocks request forgery via crafted playlists); search/ISRC query values strictly encoded; path traversal guards on library export paths; request logs redacted to host+path; DASH manifest bomb hardening

### [0.3.1] - 2026-06-17

LOSSLESS FLAC playback now works for LOSSLESS subscribers by default. DASH segment parser rewritten against `python-tidal` semantics.

#### Added
- LOSSLESS FLAC by default for LOSSLESS subscribers (preference checkbox ticked by default; untick to fall back to 320kbps HIGH)
- Raw MPD manifest XML logged when DASH is enabled, for easier diagnosis

#### Fixed
- Segment count derived from `<SegmentTimeline><S r="N"/>` elements (was: `mediaPresentationDuration / segmentDuration`, undercounted)
- `media[$Number$=0]` treated as the init segment, no separate init download (was: separate init + media[1..N], producing malformed fMP4)
- FLAC content type routed via `audio/x-flac` so fb2k picks the FLAC decoder (was: always `audio/mp4`)
- DASH codec normalisation for `flac`, `mp4a.*`, `ec-3`, `ac-4`

### [0.3.0] - 2026-05-17

Fixes the long-standing "playback stops until restart" cascade and restores drag-drop to SimPlaylist + free column resizing. Adds token-state visibility, Year/Tracks columns in the album browser, and an experimental DASH toggle for true LOSSLESS.

#### Added
- Album browser: Year and Tracks columns
- Preferences: token status line with expiry countdown and last-refresh outcome
- Preferences: experimental DASH toggle for true LOSSLESS (off by default, untested)
- Stream-open diagnostics and premature-EOF detection always logged

#### Fixed
- Playback cascade through the playlist on aborted preloads (decoder treated cancellations as track failures)
- Tidal browser column can be resized freely in fb2k layouts
- Drag-drop to SimPlaylist (URL emitted as NSPasteboardTypeURL)
- Reconnect button no longer hangs on success path
- Refresh-token rotation honoured; 401 auto-retry transparent

#### Changed
- Quality-fallback log is unambiguous about silent API downgrades
- Refresh/token logs always visible regardless of debug-logging setting

### [0.2.0] - 2026-02-13

#### Added
- Initial public release: browser, search, library, playlists, sync, ISRC matching, album art
